# Escape the matrix project

For the intake project at buas I needed to make a game using a template buas made available in C++. The idea is to make a game in C++ without using a conventional game engine. i made a game inspired by breakout, but with weird shapes instead of blocks.

## Cat Media and Gourmet Technologies
This Is the best game i colaborated on. It's a cooking game where you add ingredients to the dish using a match-3 puzzle mechanic. by swiping you can swap ingredients in a grid to make a line of 3 of the same ingredient. This adds the ingredient to the dish. Keep matching untill the dish is complete. if you accedentally match the wrong ingredient the dish will disapoint the customer, which lowers youor score. if you max out your score you win the game. As a team we have received a lot of positive feedback. I made the swiping detection and 3 in a row detection and resolution.

## Churn and Earn
I colaborated on this gamejam game. It's a cookie clicker style game, where you click buttons to buy and sell products.
with a group of 4(2 angineers and 2 artists) people in 48 hours. It's a cookie clicker style game, with buying and selling products. We colaborated on the concept and me and the other engineer did desing on the side. For this project took the lead in designing the UI and set it up in the engine. i also implemented basic coin and resource counters and resource production, aswell as a level up system. I did playtesting, balance testing and fine tuning. While playtesting the game i realized i could make the quantity slider a gameplay mechanic in itself, by making the sell button only work if you have enough products to sell them all at once. I also chose to speed up the resource production for unlocked products as it felt more rewarding.
