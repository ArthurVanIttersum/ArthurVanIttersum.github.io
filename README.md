Game Jam Churn and earn
This is a game i worked on in a group project of 4 people in 48 hours. It's a cookie clicker style game, with buying and selling products. For this project we had 2 engineers and 2 artists. We colaborated on the concept and me and the other engineer did desing on the side. For this project took the lead in designing the UI and set it up in the engine. i also implemented basic coin and resource counters and resource production, aswell as a level up system. I did playtesting, balance testing and fine tuning.

For this project i also did playtesting, balance testing and fine tuning. While playtesting the game i realized i could make the quantity slider a gameplay mechanic in itself, by making the sell button only work if you have enough products to sell them all at once. I also chose to speed up the resource production for unlocked products as it felt more rewarding.

C++ project break the matrix

For the intake project at buas I needed to make a game using a template buas made available in C++. The idea is to make a game in C++ without using a conventional game engine. i made a game inspired by breakout, but with weird shapes instead of blocks.
